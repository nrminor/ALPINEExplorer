    "### Overview of this notebook\n",
    "This notebook is meant to document and also reproduce the exploratory data analysis we've done on the results from our pipeline [ALPINE](https://github.com/nrminor/ALPINE), which is designed to identify high-interest pathogens in large databases. The notebook will walk readers through this exploratory analysis and both showcase and benefit from the Julia language ecosystem for scientific reproducibility and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as exploratory data analysis in notebooks go, you may notice this one is a bit unusual: most of the code is absent. Julia is a very fast language, compared to Python and R, but its speed comes from *precompilation*; unlike Python and R, which computers make sense of line by line, Julia can be translated into computer-speak ahead of time. To use a metaphor, the process of reading a piece of Russian literature as a native Engligh speaker is very slow, as the Russian has to be translated into English in realtime. However, reading that same piece of literature after having it translated is much faster. Such is the case with Julia precompilation: the computer can read the code in its native tongue much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This precompilation actually has two benefits: it makes the code run faster, but it also abstracts away some of the complexity of the code itself, leaving behind only the high-level concepts of what's happening. As a result, it's not just the computer who reads the code faster--it's also the reader who reads the notebook faster, undistracted by big blocks of code. Of course, we will have to introduce a few Julia concepts to make sense of the code that remains, but bear with me. I promise it will be relatively painless.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that introduction out of the way, let's introduce what ALPINE actually does."

    "### Introduction to ALPINE\n",
    "ALPINE, an acronym for *Anachronistic Lineage and Persistent INfection Explorer*, is a high-throughput, reproducible pipeline for discovering pathogen sequences with either of the following characteristics:\n",
    "1. The pathogen sequence is highly mutated relative to co-occurring pathogen sequences, indicating that it evolved a great deal in ways that more common pathogen variants haven't.\n",
    "2. The pathogen hails from a lineage that is no longer circulating, or at least no longer prevalent. The most parsimonious explanation for this \"past-their-time\" pathogens is that they have persisted in a long infection of an immunocompromised person, though it's also possible that these sequences stem from pathogens that have spilled back from animal reservoirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "ALPINE generates very rich results, with sequence data and metadata for highly evolved sequences, anachronistic sequences, and sequences that are in the Venn overlap between the two. Rather than digging through these results haphazardly, this notebook is meant to establish a workflow for digging through them. Data visualizations and statistics will be baked in. A manuscript for ALPINE is in preparation now, but we think of this notebook as complementary/serving a different purpose. By going through and running the code in this notebook yourself, you will effectively reproduce not just the results, but also the figures we generated for the manuscript."
